# DMTool

- Current goals for the DM Tool:
  - Maintain up-to-date information for the material within the DnD multiverse.
  - Provide DnD Dungeon Masters with a single location containing all established material within the DnD multiverse.
  - Develop a quick-search function when searching for feats, items, spells, tools, or weapons (FIST-W).
  - Provide a filtering feature while searching for FIST-W.
  - Allow customizable and original content (OC) FIST-W material.
  - Establish a simple UI that allows for easy navigation to all the above-listed capabilities.

- Future goals for the DM Tool:
  - Develop an "ad-lib adventure" creation tool to allow DMs to quickly build side and one-shot adventures.
  




This application will be built utilizing the Django framework with a front-end and UI consisting of a basic HTML, CSS, and JS stack.
